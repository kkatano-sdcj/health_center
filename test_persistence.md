# Testing Result Persistence

## Test Procedure

1. **First Conversion**
   - Upload a file (e.g., test1.txt)
   - Convert it
   - Verify the result appears in the results section
   - Note: File list should clear after conversion

2. **Second Conversion (without clearing)**
   - Upload another file (e.g., test2.txt)
   - Convert it
   - Verify BOTH results are now visible (test1.txt and test2.txt results)
   - Note: Previous results should still be visible

3. **Third Conversion (batch)**
   - Upload multiple files (e.g., test3.csv and another file)
   - Convert them
   - Verify ALL previous results plus new ones are visible

4. **Clear All Button**
   - Click the "すべてクリア" (Clear All) button
   - Verify all results are cleared

5. **Page Reload**
   - After adding some results, perform a hard reload (Ctrl+Shift+R or Cmd+Shift+R)
   - Verify results are cleared after reload

## Expected Behavior

✅ Results accumulate across multiple conversions
✅ Results persist until explicitly cleared via "Clear All" button
✅ Results are cleared on page hard reload
✅ File selection list clears after each conversion (but results remain)

## Implementation Details

Changed in `/frontend/src/app/convert/page.tsx`:
- Line 139: Commented out `setResults([])` to preserve previous results
- Line 172: Changed to append results: `setResults(prevResults => [...prevResults, ...conversionResults])`
- Line 245: Changed URL conversion to append: `setResults(prevResults => [...prevResults, result])`
- Line 64: Changed temp result creation to append: `setResults(prevResults => [...prevResults, tempResult])`

The only place where results are cleared is:
- Line 346: `onClearAll={() => setResults([])}` - This is the "Clear All" button handler
